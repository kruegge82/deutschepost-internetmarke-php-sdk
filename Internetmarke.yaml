        __This request is the precondition for almost all other calls!__
        
        The call provides you with the Bearer token which is then used for all other calls.
        
        Here is how:
        The client makes a POST request to the 'user' resource by adding the following parameters 
        using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format with a character
        encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP request body:
        
        * grant_type __REQUIRED__. Must be set to "client_credentials".
        
        * client_id __REQUIRED__ (aka client_id (api key)  -- obtained in DHL Developer Portal)
        
        * client_secret __REQUIRED__ (aka client_secret -- obtained in DHL Developer Portal)
        
        * username __REQUIRED__. 
        
        * password __REQUIRED__. 
        
        The internetmarke credentials (username, password) for production access will be provided during onboarding, along with additional information. For sandbox access, suitable default values exist. See the remainder of the documentation.
